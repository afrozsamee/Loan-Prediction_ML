# Loan-Prediction_ML
 I walked you through the process I followed to predict whether a loan was granted successfully or not. I used the logistic regression machine learning algorithm and the Python libraries Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning. For data visualization, I worked with Matplotlib and Seaborn, and for more interactive analysis, I used Plotly.
