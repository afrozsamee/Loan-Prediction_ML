# <span style="color:purple">**Check Your Chances To Get A Loan**</span>.

Hi, this is Afroz Samee. Thank you for your interest in reading this notebook. In this notebook, I walked you through the process I followed to predict whether a loan was granted successfully or not. I used the logistic regression machine learning algorithm and the Python libraries **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data cleaning. For data visualization, I worked with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, and for more interactive analysis, I used **Plotly**. 

This may sound technical and new to some of you, but trust me, it isnâ€™t. By the end of this notebook, you will have learned or gained a clearer understanding of machine learning techniques.

## How is this Notebook Different?

The main question is: how is my notebook different from others available online? Simply put, the uniqueness of this notebook lies in the fact that it not only explains *what* steps were taken to achieve the result but also *why* these steps were necessary. Additionally, I provided brief explanations for various functions and comparisons on which techniques are better suited for specific use cases.
There are no doubt *numerous* tutorials on loan prediction, especially on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e10/code); however, many of these tutorials offer limited explanations and, at times, feature an overuse of graphs without much added value. For example, these [notebook1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashoksuthar/s4e10-loan-approval-prediction), [notebook2](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sulaniishara/ps4-e10-eda-loan-approval-prediction) is primarily filled with graphs without sufficient context.

While the prediction accuracy of this model may not be perfect, I believe this notebook serves as a helpful guide to creating and improving a machine learning model. It demonstrates the steps involved in modeling, offers a framework for building meaningful explanations, and encourages further exploration of algorithms to compare their accuracies and false-positive rates.
